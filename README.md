## üìä Advanced End-to-End Power BI Project | Real-World Business Analytics Case Study

This project demonstrates advanced Power BI capabilities applied to real-world retail data from Costco, focusing on interactive dashboard design, KPI development, and DAX-based business insights. The goal was to analyze sales performance, profit trends, and regional growth through a highly dynamic and visually compelling dashboard.

# üöÄ Project Overview

## Objective:
To design a professional, data-driven Power BI dashboard that delivers key business insights ‚Äî total revenue, profit, and growth trends ‚Äî enabling executives to evaluate performance across regions and segments efficiently.

## Key Outcomes:

- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing $2.8M+ in revenue and 49K+ orders.

- Implemented custom DAX measures to calculate YoY growth, profit margins, and KPI comparisons versus targets. 

- Enhanced query performance and usability with custom bookmarks, slicers, and dynamic visual storytelling.

- Created a real-world, interview-ready portfolio project showcasing advanced analytical and visualization skills.

## üß© Problem Statement

Costco‚Äôs management required a unified view of key business metrics ‚Äî sales, profit, and growth ‚Äî across multiple regions and time periods.
The goal was to:

- Track KPIs against targets.

- Compare performance by region, segment, and product.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps & Methodology
### 1. Identifying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Total Revenue, Total Profit, Total Quantity Sold, Regional Sales Growth, Profit Margins, Order Achievement vs. Target

### 2. Data Cleaning & Transformation (Power Query)

- All preprocessing performed within Power BI ‚Äî not Excel.
- Removed duplicates and nulls, validated data types.
- Split columns (e.g., Country-City) using delimiters.
- Merged Global Sales with Products tables via Product_ID for price and cost data.
- Created custom columns for Net Sales and Profit using Power Query formulas.
- Eliminated redundant columns (start/end dates) to streamline model performance.

### 3. Data Modeling

- Established relational model connecting Global_Sales, Products, and newly created Date table (M:1 cardinality).
- Built a dynamic Date Table using DAX with derived fields for Year, Quarter, and Month Start Date.
- Marked Date table as primary for time-intelligence calculations.

### 4. DAX Measures & Calculations

- Centralized all calculations in a dedicated Measures Table:
- Total Revenue, Total Profit, Total Orders
- YoY and Target Calculations (Target = 1.5x Previous Year)
- Created advanced KPI measures for % Growth vs. Target and prior-year comparison using CALCULATE, FILTER, and DATEADD functions.

### 5. Dashboard Design & Visualization

Implemented dark-themed executive dashboard with Costco branding.
Designed custom bookmarks and slicer panels for intuitive interactivity.
Visual elements include:
- **Line chart for Revenue vs. Target**
- **Donut chart for Revenue by Segment**
- **Bar chart for Regional Profit Distribution**
- **Gauge for Order Achievement vs. Target**
- **Geographic Map for Statewise Revenue**
- **Added Year slicers and region filters with toggle animations for a seamless user experience.**

### üìà Key Insights Generated

- **Total Revenue: $2.8M+, Total Profit: $1.6M+, Total Orders: 49K+**
- **South and West regions contributed the highest profit margins.**
- **Corporate segment generated 27.5% of total revenue, while Home Delivery dominated consumer share.**
- **Visualized YoY growth trends and pinpointed underperforming product categories.**

### üèÜ Learning & Outcomes
 
- Mastered end-to-end BI workflow: Data Cleaning ‚Üí Modeling ‚Üí Visualization ‚Üí Storytelling
- Gained advanced proficiency in DAX, Power Query, and interactive dashboard design.
- Built a portfolio-ready dashboard demonstrating business acumen and analytical storytelling ‚Äî key skills for Data & Business Analyst roles at firms like Amazon, Amex, and Swiggy.
